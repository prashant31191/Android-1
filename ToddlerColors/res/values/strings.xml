    <string name="about">About Toddler Colors</string>
    <string name="about_text">\Toddler Colors is all about colors where toddlers can learn and associate
     colors with day-to-day objects that they see around them like fruits and vegetables.
     This will also help them learn to recognize those common objects 
     and find similarity between those objects based on color . 
     Example: 
     Apple is a fruit.
     Tomato is a vegetable.
     Both are red in color.
